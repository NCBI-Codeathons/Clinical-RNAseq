# Why use ViraVate?

ViraVate ("vee-rah-vah-tey") is a straightfoward way to understand if there are differences in viral infection derived variants in the data you already have.  The only necessary inputs are your data.  No viral infection derived variants knowledge required, but if you have genetic variants you are interested in, this can be input to the code.

# How to ger ViraVate (i.e., installation instructions):

### Docker?

### Installing ViraVate from Github

1.
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/NCBI-Codeathons/Clinical-RNAseq.git
</code></pre>
2.
[]Anything else?

### Configuration

# How to use ViraVate:

ViraVate takes inputs of (1) a gene expression matrix from a study containing two groups and (2) a key to indicate which data belongs to a ‘control’ versus the ‘experimental’ group.  The output of ViraVate is a list of the viral infection derived variants between the control and experimental groups.

ViraVate requires two inputs from the user.  The first input is a gene expression matrix from a study containing two groups (Fig #).  The second input is a key to indicate which data belongs to a ‘control’ versus the ‘experimental’ group (Fig #).  While the author provided compilation of variants of interest, there is an optional input for the user to include additional genetic variants.

 Running ViraVate is easily run with the following line(s) of code in <R?>:
 
<pre><code>This is a code block.
</code></pre>

The output of X will indicate significantly different viral infection derived variants between the control and experimental groups (Fig. #).
